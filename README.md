# nanodash

A tiny, lightweight framework for building info boards based purely on client-side JS/HTML. Based on Bootstrap for typography & layout and jQuery for grabbing and twerking data.

Possibly a bad idea if it requires you to put API keys into the HTML so don't be a doofus. Maybe add some basic-auth in your production environment or hide behind a no-robots file.

## Wanna help?

Please do...

## Setup

I'm using gulp to watch and compile my Slim templates and concat and minify my javascript.

To make this work, you'll need to install Gulp (probably via NPM) and Slim.

TODO: add more instructions on how to do this.
