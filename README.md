# nanodash

A tiny, lightweight framework for building info boards based purely on client-side JS/HTML. Based on Bootstrap for typography & layout and jQuery for grabbing and twerking data.

Possibly a bad idea if it requires you to put API keys into the HTML so don't be a doofus. Maybe add some basic-auth in your production environment or hide behind a no-robots file.

## Wanna help?
