//Bruce Mau's incomplete manifesto for growth
//NOTE: ECMA6 allows you to use backticks (``) for multi-line strings. Alas, my old-ass iPad doesn't support ECMA6... so I've done the classic hack of replacing newlines with **. Should be irrelevant when we're loading lines from a Google Doc (someday)
var lines = "Allow events to change you. You have to  be willing to grow. Growth is different from something that happens to you. You produce it. You live it. The prerequisites for growth: the openness to experience events and the willingness to be changed by them.**Forget about good. Good is a known quantity. Good is what we all agree on. Growth is not necessarily good. Growth is an exploration of unlit recesses that may or may not yield to our research. As long as you stick to good you’ll never have real growth.**Process is more important than outcome. When the outcome drives the process we will only ever go to where we’ve already been. If process drives outcome we may not know where we’re going, but we will know we want to be there.**Love your experiments (as you would an ugly child). Joy is the engine of growth. Exploit the liberty in casting your work as beautiful experiments, iterations, attempts, trials, and errors. Take the long view and allow yourself the fun of failure every day.**Go deep. The deeper you go the more likely you will discover something of value.**Capture accidents. The wrong answer is the right answer in search of a different question. Collect wrong answers as part of the process. Ask different questions.**Study. A studio is a place of study. Use the necessity of production as an excuse to study. Everyone will benefit.**Drift. Allow yourself to wander aimlessly. Explore adjacencies. Lack judgment. Postpone criticism.**Begin anywhere. John Cage tells us that not knowing where to begin is a common form of paralysis. His advice: begin anywhere.**Everyone is a leader. Growth happens. Whenever it does, allow it to emerge. Learn to follow when it makes sense. Let anyone lead.**Harvest ideas. Edit applications. Ideas need a dynamic, fluid, generous environment to sustain life. Applications, on the other hand, benefit from critical rigor. Produce a high ratio of ideas to applications.**Keep moving. The market and its operations have a tendency to reinforce success. Resist it. Allow failure and migration to be part of your practice.**Slow down. Desynchronize from standard time frames and surprising opportunities may present themselves.**Don’t be cool. Cool is conservative fear dressed in black. Free yourself from limits of this sort.**Ask stupid questions. Growth is fuelled by desire and innocence. Assess the answer, not the question. Imagine learning throughout your life at the rate of an infant.**Collaborate. The space between people working together is filled with conflict, friction, strife, exhilaration, delight, and vast creative potential.**____________________. Intentionally left blank. Allow space for the ideas you haven’t had yet, and for the ideas of others.**Stay up late. Strange things happen when you’ve gone too far, been up too long, worked too hard, and you’re separated from the rest of the world.**Work the metaphor. Every object has the capacity to stand for something other than what is apparent. Work on what it stands for.**Be careful to take risks. Time is genetic. Today is the child of yesterday and the parent of tomorrow. The work you produce today will create your future.**Repeat yourself. If you like it, do it again. If you don’t like it, do it again.**Make your own tools. Hybridize your tools in order to build unique things. Even simple tools that are your own can yield entirely new avenues of exploration. Remember, tools amplify our capacities, so even a small tool can make a big difference.**Stand on someone’s shoulders. You can travel farther carried on the accomplishments of those who came before you. And the view is so much better.**Avoid software. The problem with software is that everyone has it.**Don’t clean your desk. You might find something in the morning that you can’t see tonight.**Don’t enter awards competitions. Just don’t. It’s not good for you.**Read only left–hand pages. Marshall McLuhan did this. By decreasing the amount of information, we leave room for what he called our ‘noodle’.**Make new words. Expand the lexicon. The new conditions demand a new way of thinking. The thinking demands new forms of expression. The expression generates new conditions.**Think with your mind. Forget technology. Creativity is not device–dependent.**Organization = Liberty. Real innovation in design, or any other field, happens in context. That context is usually some form of cooperatively managed enterprise. Frank Gehry, for instance, is only able to realize Bilbao because his studio can deliver it on budget. The myth of a split between ‘creatives’ and ‘suits’ is what Leonard Cohen calls a “charming artifact of the past.”**Don’t borrow money. Once again, Frank Gehry’s advice. By maintaining financial control, we maintain creative control. It’s not exactly rocket science, but it’s surprising how hard it is to maintain this discipline, and how many have failed.**Listen carefully. Every collaborator who enters our orbit brings with him or her a world more strange and complex than any we could ever hope to imagine. By listening to the details and the subtlety of their needs, desires, or ambitions, we fold their world onto our own. Neither party will ever be the same.**Take field trips. The bandwidth of the world is greater than that of your TV set, or the Internet, or even a totally immersive, interactive, dynamically rendered, object–oriented, real–time, computer graphic–simulated environment.**Make mistakes faster. This isn’t my idea—I borrowed it. I think it belongs to Andy Grove.**Imitate. Don’t be shy about it. Try to get as close as you can. You’ll never get all the way, and the separation might be truly remarkable. We have only to look to Richard Hamilton and his version of Marcel Duchamp’s large glass to see how rich, discredited, and underused imitation is as a technique.**Scat. When you forget the words, do what Ella did: make up something else… but not words.**Break it, stretch it, bend it, crush it, crack it, fold it.**Explore the other edge. Great liberty exists when we avoid trying to run with the technological pack. We can’t find the leading edge because it’s trampled underfoot. Try using old–tech equipment made obsolete by an economic cycle but still rich with potential.**Coffee breaks, cab rides, green rooms. Real growth often happens outside of where we intend it to, in the interstitial spaces—what Dr. Seuss calls “the waiting place.” Hans Ulrich Obrist once organized a science and art conference with all of the infrastructure of a conference—the parties, chats, lunches, airport arrivals—but with no actual conference. Apparently it was hugely successful and spawned many ongoing collaborations.**Avoid fields. Jump fences. Disciplinary boundaries and regulatory regimes are attempts to control the wilding of creative life. They are often understandable efforts to order what are manifold, complex, evolutionary processes. Our job is to jump the fences and cross the fields.**Laugh. People visiting the studio often comment on how much we laugh. Since I’ve become aware of this, I use it as a barometer of how comfortably we are expressing ourselves.**Remember. Growth is only possible as a product of history. Without memory, innovation is merely novelty. History gives growth a direction. But a memory is never perfect. Every memory is a degraded or composite image of a previous moment or event. That’s what makes us aware of its quality as a past and not a present. It means that every memory is new, a partial construct different from its source, and, as such, a potential for growth itself.**Power to the people. Play can only happen when people feel they have control over their lives. We can’t be free agents if we’re not free."

//Charles Eames Q&A
lines = lines + "**Q: “What is your definition of ‘Design,’ Monsieur Eames? A: “One could describe Design as a plan for arranging elements to accomplish a particular purpose.”**Q: “Is Design an expression of art?” A: “I would rather say it’s an expression of purpose. It may, if it is good enough, later be judged as art.”**Q: “Is Design a craft for industrial purposes?” A: “No, but Design may be a solution to some industrial problems.”**Q: “What are the boundaries of Design?” A: “What are the boundaries of problems?”**Q: “Is Design a discipline that concerns itself with only one part of the environment?” A: “No.”**Q: “Is it a method of general expression?” A: “No. It is a method of action.”**Q: “Is Design a creation of an individual?” A: “No, because to be realistic, one must always recognize the influence of those that have gone before.”**Q: “Is Design a creation of a group?” A: “Very often.”**Q: “Is there a Design ethic?” A: “There are always Design constraints, and these often imply an ethic.”**Q: “Does Design imply the idea of products that are necessarily useful?”**A: “Yes, even though the use might be very subtle.”**Q: “Is it able to cooperate in the creation of works reserved solely for pleasure?” A: “Who would say that pleasure is not useful?”**Q: “Ought form to derive from the analysis of function?” A: “The great risk here is that the analysis may be incomplete.”**Q: “Can the computer substitute for the Designer?” A: “Probably, in some special cases, but usually the computer is an aid to the Designer.”**Q: “Does Design imply industrial manufacture?” A: “Not necessarily.”**Q: “Is Design used to modify an old object through new techniques?” A: “This is one kind of Design problem.”**Q: “Is Design used to fit up an existing model so that it is more attractive?” A: “One doesn’t usually think of Design in this way.”**Q: “Is Design an element of industrial policy?” A: “If Design constraints imply an ethic, and if industrial policy includes ethical principles, then yes—design is an element in an industrial policy.”**Q: “Does the creation of Design admit constraint?” A: “Design depends largely on constraints.” Q: “What constraints?” A: “The sum of all constraints. Here is one of the few effective keys to the Design problem: the ability of the Designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible; his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints. Constraints of price, of size, of strength, of balance, of surface, of time, and so forth. Each problem has its own peculiar list.”**Q: “Does Design obey laws?” A: “Aren’t constraints enough?”**Q: “Are there tendencies and schools in Design?” A: “Yes, but these are more a measure of human limitations than of ideals.”**Q: “Is Design ephemeral?” A: “Some needs are ephemeral. Most designs are ephemeral.”**Q: “Ought Design to tend towards the ephemeral or towards permanence?” A: “Those needs and Designs that have a more universal quality tend toward relative permanence.”**Q: “How would you define yourself with respect to a decorator? an interior architect? a stylist?” A: “I wouldn’t.”**Q: “To whom does Design address itself: to the greatest number? to the specialists or the enlightened amateur? to a privileged social class?” A: “Design addresses itself to the need.”**Q: “After having answered all these questions, do you feel you have been able to practice the profession of ‘Design’ under satisfactory conditions, or even optimum conditions?” A: “Yes.”**Q: “Have you been forced to accept compromises?” A: “I don’t remember ever being forced to accept compromises, but I have willingly accepted constraints.”**Q: “What do you feel is the primary condition for the practice of Design and for its propagation?” A: “A recognition of need.”**Q: “What is the future of Design?”"

//Jackson Pollock
lines += "**Painting is self-discovery. Every good artist paints what he is.**New needs need new techniques. And the modern artists have found new ways and new means of making their statements... the modern painter cannot express this age, the airplane, the atom bomb, the radio, in the old forms of the Renaissance or of any other past culture. **It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well. **I continue to get further away from the usual painter's tools such as easel, palette, brushes, etc. **It doesn't make much difference how the paint is put on as long as something has been said. Technique is just a means of arriving at a statement. **I don't work from drawings. I don't make sketches and drawings and color sketches into a final painting. **The modern artist... is working and expressing an inner world - in other words - expressing the energy, the motion, and other inner forces. **I have no fear of making changes, destroying the image, etc., because the painting has a life of its own. **Abstract painting is abstract. It confronts you. There was a reviewer a while back who wrote that my pictures didn't have any beginning or any end. He didn't mean it as a compliment, but it was. **Today painters do not have to go to a subject matter outside of themselves. Most modern painters work from a different source. They work from within. **When I say artist I mean the man who is building things - creating molding the earth - whether it be the plains of the west - or the iron ore of Penn. It's all a big game of construction - some with a brush - some with a shovel - some choose a pen. **The strangeness will wear off and I think we will discover the deeper meanings in modern art. **On the floor I am more at ease. I feel nearer, more part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting. **The painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come through. **He drove his kind of realism at me so hard I bounced right into nonobjective painting. **My painting does not come from the easel. **When I am in my painting, I'm not aware of what I'm doing. **When I'm painting, I'm not aware of what I'm doing. It's only after a get acquainted period that I see what I've been about. I've no fears about making changes for the painting has a life of its own. **I'm very representational some of the time, and a little all of the time. But when you're painting out of your unconscious, figures are bound to emerge. **The modern artist is working with space and time, and expressing his feelings rather than illustrating. **My paintings do not have a center, but depend on the same amount of interest throughout."
